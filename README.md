# RoC-eX: Robotic Cave Explorer
**Unearth the truth about what happened in cave system #0393**

Dive into the experience of piloting a robotic scout through what appears to be an ancient cave system leading down to the centre of the Earth. With the help of advanced sensors, guide your robot explorer along dark tunnels and caverns, avoiding obstacles, collecting relics of aeons past and, hopefully, discover what happened to its predecessor. 

We hope playing the game will teach you about how sensors work, how they are used in reality and perhaps give a glimpse into the mind of the robot. With luck, this can show how exciting it can be to work in robotics! 

## Playing the game

The game is currently hosted on [this website](https://www.farscope.bris.ac.uk/game) as part of the [UKRAS festival of Robotics 2021](https://www.ukras.org/robotics-week/)

## Extending the game
